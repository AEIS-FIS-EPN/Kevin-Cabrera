This project is a single-page web application (SPA) developed using React. It's designed as an interactive platform showcasing personal and professional information akin to an online curriculum vitae. The application features sections covering educational background, certifications, completed courses, highlighted skills, and user hobbies. With a clean and modern design, users can easily navigate the application to learn more about me.
